Virtual class 

I did ct at the cube last year and it was fun to be in the room because the lighting was calming and Mr.Best played the sounds from star treck and it was fun because we made 3D stuff on the headsets and we did some easy stuff and some hard stuff but Mr.Best was there tohelp with everything. 

first thing we did for CT in tenth grade was VR (for me at least) and we did things with fitness on the headsets. it was tai chi to watching the waves on youtube on sandy beaches. 

I would like to actually know what im doing when im coding because i barely know what im doing so i would like to know what im doing fully. 

actually coding is hard for me because it is very confusing and is very fast pased so i feel like i am typing a little faster from the fast paced work. 

My goal in CT this year is to get better at coding in general and to try it out for the rest of this year even though ive decided that its not for me but there are lots of things i could do in coding so i wanna try some of them and maybe ill grow to like them but i should at least try.
