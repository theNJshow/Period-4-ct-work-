how to use the code:
Add to list (1): you can add a number of your choosing to find in the list of other numbers 

Add a bunch of numbers (2): you can tell the list how many numbers you want and where to stop at. 
Return @ an index position (3):

Print contents (4):the code prints your list again 

Random choice (5): your code gives you a random number at a random index position. 

Linear search (6): the code finds the number you type in and finds a number for you at the correct index 

Recursive binary search (7): it looks for your number but if it cant find it it tells you it isn'there

Iterative binary search (8):type in another number and it will look for it at a different index position. 

Print lists (9): it prints your list of numbers after you tell it to 

Quit (10): it stops the list from printing 



discribe binary search:
binary search finds numbers at a diffefent index value or like a different type of code 


what changes would i make: 
i would make the list go in cronological order and highlight the number i look for and also keep it clean and neat.
